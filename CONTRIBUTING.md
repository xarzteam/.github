# Contributing

BioXARZ-2 is a free project and anyone can be part of it, either by reporting
bugs or helping the community, as long as it is with good intentions. This
would be the easiest way to contribute, but if you wish to contribute in other
ways, you can do the following:

* Documenting the code and the wiki
* Correct bugs in the code
* Correct spelling mistakes
* Debugging the software
* Testing performance

These would be the technical ways to contribute and don't worry if you are a
beginner, you can improve with time.
