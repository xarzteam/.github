# Welcome to the BioXARZ-2 development center!

![Logo](logo.svg)

The XARZ Team is a small group of video game fans, and we are also the
developers of [BioXARZ-2](https://github.com/xarzteam/bioxarz-2) and other
derived projects, either a plugin for the engine or a resource pack.

This development center is used to host the source code of our projects, and in
turn correct errors or perform tests, although it is mostly to facilitate the
creation of derivatives.

If you want to be part of our community, you can join our
[Discord](https://discord.gg/dxq5uvyDJB) server.
