# Governance

The projects of this organization are maintained by The XARZ Team, a group of
video game fans and the developers of
[BioXARZ-2](https://github.com/xarzteam/bioxarz-2), but they are also usually
maintained by their community, either by contributing to its development or by
helping the community.

Unlike other developers, we don't seek to kill creativity and for that reason
we like to listen to the community's ideas, in addition to allowing the
creation of derivative projects. This is possible because our projects are free
and modification and redistribution of them is allowed, as long as the terms of
the licenses are met and there are no destructive intentions.

If you want to know more about The XARZ Team, you can take a look at their
[website](https://xarzteam.vercel.app/).
