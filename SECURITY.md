# Security Failures

Security failures are errors or gaps in software code that can cause
vulnerabilities in the system and facilitate a malicious attack, since system
security has been weakened.

If you find a security error in any of our projects, please report it
immediately in Issues or via our [email](mailto:bioxarz2@gmail.com). We will do
our best to resolve it as soon as possible.
